No special snowflakes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With single player, it can be fun to have unique traits to guide you as you play through your story. But I feel that in multiplayer the leaders aren''t balanced and so rather than playing a game where it''s one player''s skill against another, it''s mostly about who chose (or was dealt) the strongest leader.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Consider playing a chess game where one player starts with an extra knight at the beginning of the game, but 30-moves later the other player gets an extra queen. That could be an interesting game, but it''s less a contest about the players'' own chess skills and more about which "bonus unit" is overall better.
